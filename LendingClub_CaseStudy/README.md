## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- Lending club which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant's profile.
- Identify the driving factor for defaulters (Charged Off) for the customers to which Lending Club has provided the loan
- Lending Club loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011.



## Conclusions
- NV and AK states have high percentage of defaulters . Company needs to take extra caution while providing loan.
- Most percentage of defaulters are from the year 2007 since there was recession . When there are sign of recession or during recession banks should provide loans for purpose of Medical and in case for other purpose should consider lowering the interest Rate and set a limit on the Loan amount .
- Regarding Mortgage customers company is loaning higher amount for purpose not associated to House , company needs to take extra caution as they do already need to pay Mortgage amount along with other credit accounts 
- As the loan amount is high for Small Business and Housing , lot of defaulters are under it hence company need to produce new strategy to tackle these customers by taking more stake regarding their business or house. 
- We see a greater number of Not Verified defaulters requested loan for Medical purpose as it can't be denied , company should think to lower the interest rate for these loans so small instalments can easily be paid .
- When a customers is Not Verified and with no Bankruptcy record , company should try to not provide higher loans when reported Annual Income is high.
- Company should not be providing Higher Loan amount for Not Verified customers except for Medical purpose.
- Company needs to ramp up Verification status as  43% of customers are not verified and it's a risk in lending loans without performing proper background verifications
